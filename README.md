# Super Social Project (2SN) 
etna-alternance.net - Software Engineerers - March 2017 promotion

## Presentation
	This is a 5 months team project for the bachelors (bac +3) students.
	We have to use any PHP framework to create a scalable social network.
	After a study of the differents available PHP frameworks on the market
	and due to the current knowledge of some of our members,
	we decided it would be in the best for this project to use Symfony2.
